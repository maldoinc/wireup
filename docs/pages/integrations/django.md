Dependency injection for Django is available via the provided integration in `wireup.integration.django`.


**Features:**

- [x] Inject dependencies in Django views.
    * Supports functions and class-based views.
    * Eliminates the need for `@container.autowire`.
- [x] Expose `django.http.HttpRequest` as a wireup dependency.
    * Available as a `TRANSIENT` scoped dependency, your services can ask for a django request object.

## Installation

To install the integration, add `wireup.integration.django` to `INSTALLED_APPS`, define a new `WIREUP` setting and add the wireup middleware.

```python title="settings.py"
import os
from wireup.integration.django import WireupSettings

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "wireup.integration.django"
]

MIDDLEWARE = ["wireup.integration.django.wireup_middleware"]

WIREUP = WireupSettings(
    # This is a list of top-level modules containing service registrations.
    # It can be either a list of strings or module types.
    service_modules=["mysite.polls.services"]
)

# Additional application settings.
S3_BUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN = os.environ["S3_BUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN"]
```


## Usage

### Define some services

```python title="mysite/polls/services/s3_manager.py"
from wireup import service


@service
@dataclass
class S3Manager:
    # Reference configuration by name.
    # This is the same name this appears in settings.
    access_token: Annotated[str, Inject(param="S3_BUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN")]

    def upload(self, file: File) -> None: ...
```

It is also possible to use django settings in factories.

```python title="mysite/polls/services/github_client.py"
@dataclass
class GithubClient:
    api_key: str
```


```python title="mysite/polls/services/factories.py"
from wireup import service


@service
def github_client_factory() -> GithubClient:
    return GithubClient(settings.GH_API_KEY)
```

### Inject

To perform injection simply request the dependencies in the view.

```python title="app/views.py"
def upload_file_view(request: HttpRequest, s3_manager: S3Manager) -> HttpResponse:
    return HttpResponse(...)
```

Class-based views are also supported, you can specify dependencies in your class' `__init__` function. 


For more examples see the [Wireup Django integration tests](https://github.com/maldoinc/wireup/tree/master/test/integration/django/view.py).


### Testing

For general testing tips with Wireup refer to the [test docs](../testing.md). 
With Django you can override dependencies in the container as follows:

```python title="test_thing.py"
from wireup.integration.django.apps import get_container

def test_override():
    class DummyGreeter(GreeterService):
        def greet(self, name: str) -> str:
            return f"Hi, {name}"

    with get_container().override.service(GreeterService, new=DummyGreeter()):
        res = self.client.get("/greet?name=Test")
```
